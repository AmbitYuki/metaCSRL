# README for Running `run.sh`
﻿
## Introduction
﻿
This document provides comprehensive instructions on how to execute the `run.sh` script within a specific Python environment. The `run.sh` script is designed to facilitate the execution of a Python-based application that leverages the `mujoco_py`, `gym`, and `network` libraries. The instructions herein are intended to ensure that users can seamlessly run the script in a manner that is both efficient and effective.
﻿
## Prerequisites
﻿
Before running the `run.sh` script, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
﻿
1. **Operating System**: The script is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux or macOS.
2. **Python Environment**: Python 3.6 or higher must be installed on your system. You can verify your Python version by running:
```sh
python3 --version
```
3. **Mujoco**: Ensure that Mujoco is installed and properly configured. Mujoco is a physics engine for detailed and efficient rigid body simulations.
4. **Dependencies**: Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed. These dependencies are typically listed in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
﻿
## Script Overview
﻿
The `run.sh` script is a shell script that automates the execution of a Python application. It sets up the necessary environment variables and invokes the Python interpreter with the appropriate arguments. The script is designed to work within an environment that includes `mujoco_py`, `gym`, and `network`.

## Instructions for Running `run.sh`
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository containing the `run.sh` script to your local machine. Use the following command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/project.git
cd project
```
### Step 2: Make the Script Executable
Ensure that the `run.sh` script has executable permissions. You can modify the permissions using the `chmod` command:
```sh
chmod +x run.sh
```
### Step 3: Install Mujoco
﻿
Follow the official Mujoco installation guide to install Mujoco on your system. Ensure that you have the necessary license and that the Mujoco binaries are correctly placed.

### Step 4: Install Python Dependencies
﻿
Install the required Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 5: Execute the Script
﻿
Run the `run.sh` script using the following command:
```sh
./run.sh
```
### Step 6: Monitor the Output
﻿
The script will execute the Python application and display output in the terminal. Monitor the output for any errors or important information.
﻿
## Detailed Explanation of `run.sh`
﻿
Below is a detailed breakdown of the `run.sh` script:
﻿
```sh
#!/bin/bash
﻿
# Set environment variables
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
﻿
# Activate virtual environment if exists
if [ -d "venv" ]; then
source venv/bin/activate
fi
﻿
# Execute the Python script
python3 main.py "$@"
```
﻿
### Script Components
1. **Shebang**: The first line (`#!/bin/bash`) specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.
2. **Environment Variables**: The `export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)` command sets the `PYTHONPATH` to the current working directory, ensuring that Python can locate the necessary modules.
3. **Virtual Environment Activation**: If a virtual environment (`venv`) exists, it is activated using `source venv/bin/activate`. This ensures that the script runs in an isolated environment with the correct dependencies.
4. **Python Script Execution**: The `python3 main.py "$@"` command runs the `main.py` Python script, passing any additional arguments provided to `run.sh`.
